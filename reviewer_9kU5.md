![111](./reviewer_9KU5_doc/Convergence_comparison_on_the_Ackley_5D_function.PNG)
Figure 1: Convergence comparison on the Ackley 5D function, showing normalized performance across iterations. The shaded regions represent standard deviation over multiple runs. REBMBO-D reaches the 80% optimal performance threshold approximately 40% faster than other methods, demonstrating superior convergence speed and robustness.

## Table 1: Performance Comparison
![222](./reviewer_9KU5_doc/Performance_comparison_between_REBMBO_and_baseline_methods.PNG)
Table 1: Performance comparison between REBMBO and baseline methods (Two-Step EI, KG, TuRBO) across five benchmark optimization tasks under an equal computational budget. Results (mean Â± standard deviation from 5 independent runs) indicate that REBMBO variants consistently achieve superior performance, demonstrating robustness and efficiency. Higher values represent better performance.

## Table 2: Average Number of Evaluation
![333](./reviewer_9KU5_doc/Comparison_of_different_Bayesian_optimization_methods.PNG)
Table 2: Comparison of different Bayesian optimization methods, reporting the average number of evaluations required to reach 90% of optimal performance across five benchmark tasks. REBMBO variants consistently achieve the target performance with fewer evaluations, highlighting their efficiency relative to baseline methods. Lower numbers indicate better performance.

## Table 3: Comparison of Average Best Value
![444](./reviewer_9KU5_doc/Comparison_of_average_best_value_quality.PNG)
Table 3: Comparison of average best value quality (normalized performance, higher is better) across five benchmark optimization tasks. REBMBO variants consistently outperform baseline methods (Two-Step EI and KG), indicating their capability of identifying higher-quality solutions.
